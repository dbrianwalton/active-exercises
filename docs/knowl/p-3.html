<div class="para">Dynamic exercises have a number of benefits. A single dynamic exercise creates a template for a large number of related problems. In a homework system, this allows a class of students to be assigned related problems that follow a common strategy while ensuring that students are individually solving problems with different details than (most of) those around them. For a single student, dynamic exercises allow a student to try new problems to reinforce earlier practice. The computer might be able to recognize submitted answers that result from common mistakes or misconceptions and provide feedback that can guide the student to correct their error.</div>
