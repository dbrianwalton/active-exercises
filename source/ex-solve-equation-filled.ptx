  <title>Solve an Equation</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Solve the equation <m>{{m}}*x+{{b}}=0</m>
      to get the value of <m>x</m>.
    </p>
    <p><m>x = </m> <fillin width="5" correct="theAnswer" submit="solution"/></p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      We want to isolate the <m>x</m> in the equation <m>{{m}}*x+{{b}}=0</m>.
      Because addition of <m>{{b}}</m> is the last operation, we apply the inverse by adding <m>{{negB}}</m> to both sides.
      The new, but equivalent equation is now <m>{{m}}x = {{negB}}</m>.
      Dividing both sides of the equation by <m>{{m}}</m>, we obtain the solution <m>x={{theAnswer}}</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>
